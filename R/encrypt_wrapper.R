##' Wrapper functions for encryption.  These functions wrap
##' expressions that produce or consume a file and arrange to encrypt
##' (for producing functions) or decrypt (for consuming functions).
##' The forms with a trailing underscore (\code{encrypt_},
##' \code{decrypt_}) do not use any non-standard evaluation and may be
##' more useful for programming.
##'
##' These functions will not work for all functions.  For example
##' \code{pdf}/\code{dev.off} will create a file but we can't wrap
##' those up (yet!).  Functions that \emph{modify} a file (e.g.,
##' appending) also will not work and may cause data loss.

  ## pass all their arguments to write.table with a little rewriting.

  ## part of a dots argument and fn could be the pointer to the
  ## underlying function that will take the dots.

    ## pattern where the filename is NULL in the argument lists and

    ## with active binding functions that are dynamically bound back
    ## to the environment here?  But that still requires some serious

## Need to create a little lookup table of known filename arguments to
## widely used functions.  Getting a full list here is going to be a
## little hard, but so long as this is extensible it doesn't much
## matter.
##
## What seems to be required is that we know *where* to find a
## function.  So we'll get a definition which is the function as
## passed in.  The expression might be:
##   base::readRDS
## in which case we'll know that the namespace is base, or it'd be
##   readRDS
## in which case 'get' will hopefully identify the correct namespace
## by being the enclosing namespace.  That's prone to abuse with
##   environment(foo) <- as.environment("package:bar")
## but should suffice for now.  The solution would be to replace 'get'
## with something that manually traverses the environments, which I
## implemented in rrqueue.
##
## making this extensible probably requires having additional elements
## that are added to this list when the db call is run; those could
## come from a registering process easily enough (e.g., during
## \code{.onLoad()});
##   rewrite_register(package, name, arg)

## NOTE: graphics devices will take work to get working because it's
## at device *close* that the encryption should happen.  This is easy
## enough to do with dev.off() though the interface would look better
## if it was around the pdf call.
##
## Another option would be to implement enough of a stub around
## devices?  Or we could take the loggr approach and add hooks within
## dev.off() that look for registered devices.
##
## Similar things would be needed for knitr output where a hook needs
## to be added after figure generation.

##' @param package The name of the package with the function to
##'   support (as a scalar character).  If your function has no
##'   package (e.g., a function you are working on outside of a
##'   package, use "" as the name).
##' @param name The name of the function to support.
##' @param arg The name of the argument in the target function that

##'   is the value you would pass through to \code{file_arg} in

##'   around functions that pass all their arguments through to a
##'   second function as dots.  This is how \code{read.csv} works.  If
